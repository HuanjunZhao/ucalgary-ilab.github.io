abstract: "This paper is an invitation to HCI designers and artist-researchers to weave together practice-based ways of knowing with others’ experiences with their work, focused on understanding cognitive and aesthetic impressions garnered during exhibitions. It describes the first author's process for weaving together the warp (practice-based ways of knowing) and weft (interview-based insights into others’ experiences) by leveraging the exhibition site as a place to generate knowledge with attendees experiencing their work. Understanding others’ experiences informs the experimentation that practice-based knowledge generation is founded on, deepening and enriching the resulting work."
